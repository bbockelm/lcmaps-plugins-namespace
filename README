lcmaps-plugins-namespace

This LCMAPS plugin allows glexec to utilize the Linux PID
namespace feature.  It double-forks the glexec process itself.
The initial process creates a new PID namespace; the first
child acts as the 'init' process within the namespace.  The
second child proceeds as a "typical" glexec.

After the first and second child fork, they will exec the
lcmaps-namspace-init; this executable continuously reap
child processes (as does init), forward received signals,
and exit with the same status as the grandchild process.
